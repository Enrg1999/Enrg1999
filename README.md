Hi, 

I'm Enrico, an high achieving, driven student of the Bocconi University's MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics, 
an innovative course that offers a unique blend of modern statistics, mathematics and the latest advancements in computer science.

In this Github I've colected some projects I've worked on and that I think can well showcase my capabilities.

These are:
- `SaveADrop` which contains files related to the IBM Call For Code EMEA Student Competition
- `CapitalBikeShareBusinessAnalytics` which contains an analysis of Washington D.C.'s bike-sharing trends and a potential business opportunity stemming from this
- `NYCTaxiFaresBD` which contains an attempt to create a ML model that predicts NYC Taxi fares (similarly to what is done by taxi apps when you summon a ride)
- `BCCarbonTaxFinalWork` which contains the Econometrics analysis I performed for my Bachelor's Final Work

For any doubt or further information you can contact me via e-mail at [enrico.giannelli@studbocconi.it](mailto:enrico.giannelli@studbocconi.it)
