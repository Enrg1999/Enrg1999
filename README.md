Hi, 

I'm Enrico, an high achieving, driven student of the Bocconi University's MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics, 
an innovative course that offers a unique blend of modern statistics, mathematics and the latest advancements in computer science.

In this Github I've colected some projects I've worked on and that I think can well showcase my capabilities.
